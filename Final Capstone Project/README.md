            ▪ Defines the path to a text file (registration.txt) where registration data will be stored.
            ▪ Checks if the directory to store the text file exists; if not, it creates the directory.
            ▪ Writes the registration data to the text file in append mode ('a') with proper formatting.
            ▪ Redirects the user to the 'home' page or another specified page upon successful registration.





    3. submit_message(request) Function:
        ◦ Purpose: Handles user messages submitted to the chatbot.
        ◦ Functionality:
            ▪ Decorated with @csrf_exempt to bypass CSRF protection for this specific view.
            ▪ Processes POST requests containing user input data (message) in JSON format (request.body).
            ▪ Extracts the user's message from the JSON data.
            ▪ Calls the get_bot_response function to generate a response based on the user's message.
            ▪ Returns	the	bot's	response	as	a	JSON	response	({'response': bot_response}) to the frontend.
    4. get_bot_response(message) Function:
        ◦ Purpose: Generates a response from the chatbot based on the user's message.
        ◦ Functionality:
            ▪ Constructs an input text for the model by combining the user's message (message) with a context extracted from a PDF file (context).
            ▪ Utilizes the LaMini-Flan-T5-248M model and tokenizer loaded earlier to generate a response using the text2text pipeline.
            ▪ The model generates a response based on the input text, and the response is extracted from the pipeline's output.
            ▪ Returns the generated response from the model as the bot's response.

    5. Initialization and Model Loading:
        ◦ Initializes and loads the LaMini-Flan-T5-248M model and tokenizer from the transformers library.
        ◦ Defines a text2text pipeline for text generation using the loaded model and tokenizer.
    6. PDF File Path and Context Extraction:
        ◦ Specifies the path to a PDF file (pdf_file_path) containing information about the organization and courses.
        ◦ Calls the extract_text_from_pdf function to extract text content from the PDF file and stores it in the context variable for contextual analysis during response generation.

In summary, these functions work together to handle user registration, process user messages submitted to the chatbot, generate responses using a machine learning model, and manage the contextual information necessary for accurate response generation. The code integrates Django's views and libraries like PyPDF2 and transformers for efficient backend logic and communication with the frontend.
